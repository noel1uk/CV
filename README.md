A fellowship position at Makers Academy has provided an incredible opportunity for my coding passion to bud and flourish; over the last three months I have learned an incredible amount and I can say now I find myself comfortable in any position of a full stack development.

I'm driven by learning new languages and constantly striving to improve my process of learning. 

Here's some of the things I'm working on.

### <a name="background">Background</a>


For the last 5 years Iâ€™ve been running a small gourmet honey company, which I set up with mainly one intention in mind - to create an Ecommerce site from scratch and to have it as a stepping stone towards becoming a web developer. Self-teaching myself while on the job, as well as running my own business has been a great all round experience, but one of the main things it has given me was a realisation that my true passion lies in learning to code, and learning new languages to solve a variety of problems. 

My main focus has become how to adapt to each project, increase the speed of learning new languages needed and of putting them to use. I love working on projects where I start with little knowledge of the technology used and then get to witness my own growth as a developer that creates value throughout the project.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Passionate

* My main passion is learning to craft elegant code, I thoroughly enjoyed extracting the legacy code into seperate classes in the Gilded Rose kata
* I've got a real world understanding of the importance of well written code. When I was self employed my website was full of worst practices, for example, to change the price of a product it had to be altered in the database, on the product page
* I enjoy solving problems with code

#### Resourceful

* Have set up a business with next to no funds and managed it for five years
* Made an Ecommerce website for the above business from the ground up using only online tutorials

#### Adaptable

* Have started numerous coding projects with languages I don't know and have been able to use the docs and Stack Overflow  to make things that function
* Enjoy working alone, in pairs and in groups. Have coded in pairs on a daily basis for my three months at Makers Academy, either as a pair or part of a larger group
* In my honey business we would attend different events with different equipment. This has made me comfortable creating solutions on the go

#### Analytical

* I enjoy taking large problems and then breaking them down into smaller ones and being able to implement them. This is why I voted to be on the technical group for my Makers Academy final project where we made a functioning programming language
