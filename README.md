I am a full stack developer, driven by learning new languages and constantly striving to improve my process of learning. 

For the last 5 years I’ve been running a small gourmet honey company, which I’ve set up with mainly one intention in mind - to create an Ecommerce site from scratch and to have it as a stepping stone towards becoming a web developer. Self-teaching myself while on the job, as well as running my own business has been a great all round experience, but one of the main things it has given me was a realisation that my true passion lies in learning to code, and learning new languages to solve a variety of problems. 
A fellowship position at Makers Academy has provided an incredible opportunity for this passion to bud and flourish; over the last three months I have learned an incredible amount and I can say now I find myself comfortable in any position of a full stack development. 

I work easily with Ruby and Javascript, nonetheless my main focus has become how to adapt to each project, increase the speed of learning new languages needed and of putting them to use. I love working on projects where I start with little knowledge of the technology used and then get to witness my own growth as a developer that creates value throughout the project. 

Here's some of the things I'm working on.

#### Resourcefulness

* Have set up a business with next to no funds and managed it for five years
* Made an Ecommerce for the above business from the ground up using only online tutorials

#### Adaptable

* Have started numerous coding projects with languages I don't know and have been able to use the docs and stackoverflow  to make things that function
* Enjoy working alone, in pairs and in groups. Have coded in pairs on a daily basis for my three months at Makers Academy, either as a pair or part of a larger group
* In my honey business we would often attend different events and have different equipment with which to set up. This has made me comfortable creating solutions on the go

#### Analyitical

* I enjoy taking large problems and then breaking them down into smaller ones and being able to implement them. This is why I voted to be on the technical group for my Makers Academy final project where we made a functioning programming language

#### Passionate

Teaching myself how to program for the past few years and love to attend tech related
workshops such as Alexa 101 where they guided us through how to make an Alexa Skill.
