I am a full stack developer, driven by learning new languages and constantly striving to improve my process of learning. 

For the last 5 years I’ve been running a small gourmet honey company, which I’ve set up with mainly one intention in mind - to create an Ecommerce site from scratch and to have it as a stepping stone towards becoming a web developer. Self-teaching myself while on the job, as well as running my own business has been a great all round experience, but one of the main things it has given me was a realisation that my true passion lies in learning to code, and learning new languages to solve a variety of problems. 
A fellowship position at Makers Academy has provided an incredible opportunity for this passion to bud and flourish; over the last three months I have learned an incredible amount and I can say now I find myself comfortable in any position of a full stack development. 

I work easily with Ruby and Javascript, nonetheless my main focus has become how to adapt to each project, increase the speed of learning new languages needed and of putting them to use. I love working on projects where I start with little knowledge of the technology used and then get to witness my own growth as a developer that creates value throughout the project. 

Here's some of the things I'm working on.

## Skills

#### Resourcefulness

What I know about programming so far has been mainly self taught, I enjoy learning things quickly from on and offline sources and have numerous books on Ruby, PHP, javascript etc. I'm thrilled, to be living and working in the times where technology expands our worlds so much and makes all information and learning easily available. I've started a company alone with next to no resources.

#### Analyitical

I enjoy taking large problems and then breaking them down into smaller ones and being able to implement them.

#### Passionate

Teaching myself how to program for the past few years and love to attend tech related
workshops such as Alexa 101 where they guided us through how to make an Alexa Skill.
