## Noel Vock

I'm passionate about solving problems with code and for the past few years I've been running a small honey retail business in part to have a live environment in which learn to code. I'm looking for a role where I can get to grips with a wide array of challenges and solve problems  in an ambitious company, working with people who love to create things and solve problems with code.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Resourcefulness

What I know about programming so far has been mainly self taught and that shows I have great capacity for learning fast and doing my research and solving problems effectively on my own. I've started a company alone with next to no resources.
