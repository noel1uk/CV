## Noel Vock

My favourite thing is learning to code, and taking practical steps towards improving my learning process is my main aim.

Having spent the past 5 years first setting up then running an online and offline mono floral honey business which was initially meant to be something to put in my web development portfolio as an example of an ecommerce site I've now finally managed to make it into a position where I can say I'm comfortable as a full stack developer. I'm comfortable working with Ruby and Javascript while my main interest has become how to increase the speed at which I'm able to start making things in new languages.

I love working on projects where I start with little knowledge of the technology used and then get to watch myself improve as a developer and create value in the projects duration.

Here's some of the things I'm working on.


I'm passionate about solving problems with code and for the past few years I have created and been running a small honey retail business in part to have a live environment in which learn to code. I'm an aspiring full stack developer and have worked steadfastly the past few years to gain skills in html, css, PHP and MySQL. I can edit, create and expand these with precision, creatively solve problems and speed up business procedures by, for instance, linking PayPal sales to an automated response system to display on screen or in the admin section of a website. I can work with databases, construct user login systems etc. I'm looking for a role where I can get to grips with a wide array of challenges and where I get to solve problems in an ambitious company, working with people who love to create things and solve problems with code.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Resourcefulness

What I know about programming so far has been mainly self taught, I enjoy learning things quickly from on and offline sources and have numerous books on Ruby, PHP, javascript etc. I'm thrilled, to be living and working in the times where technology expands our worlds so much and makes all information and learning easily available. I've started a company alone with next to no resources.

#### Analyitical

I enjoy taking large problems and then breaking them down into smaller ones and being able to implement them.
